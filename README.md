# Milestone 1 project rebuild

The purpose of rebuilding my milestone 1 project is for a homework assessment for the advanced topics course at UNLV. The specific criteria needed to mark this project complete are as follows:

- 10-15 SCSS variables
- 10-15 nested selectors, with at least 2 uses of the SCSS ampersand (&)
- 3-5 SCSS mixins
- 2-4 SCSS functions
- 2-4 instances of SCSS flow control directives or operators
- 3-5 SCSS partial files, imported
- One of the SCSS error-handling directives

## Same project, new tech ðŸ’ª

In addition to rebuilding my first milestone project using SASS, I will enhance it by adopting TypeScript instead of vanilla JavaScript and leveraging the ReactJS framework. These updates will bring my project up to date with current technology standards.
